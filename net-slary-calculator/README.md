 ## Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Welcome to the Student Grade Generator! This is a simple JavaScript program that helps you determine a student's grade based on their marks. Just input the student's marks (between 0 and 100), and the program will output the corresponding grade.

 # Overview
The Student Grade Generator is designed to provide a quick and easy way to convert numerical student marks into letter grades. This can be especially useful for teachers, students, or anyone who needs to understand the grading system based on a typical academic scale.

 # Features
Input Validation: Ensures the grade is within the valid range (0-100).
Accurate Grading: Converts numerical marks into letter grades based on predefined criteria.
Simple Interface: Easy-to-use function that can be integrated into larger applications.
Error Handling: Returns 'Invalid grade' for inputs outside the valid range.
Getting Started
To get started with the Student Grade Generator, you'll need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript. You can run this code in any JavaScript environment, such as a browser console or a Node.js environment.

  # Usage
Here's how you can use the Student Grade Generator:

Copy the provided JavaScript function.
Paste the function into your JavaScript environment.
Call the studentGrade function with a grade as an argument.
The function will return the corresponding grade.
 Function Details
The studentGrade function is the core of this program. It takes a single parameter grade, which is a number between 0 and 100. Based on the value of grade, the function will return a letter grade according to the following criteria:

A: Grade > 79
B: 60 <= Grade <= 79
C: 50 <= Grade <= 59
D: 40 <= Grade < 50
E: 0 <= Grade <= 40
Function Declaration:

function studentGrade(grade) { ... } - This declares the function studentGrade that takes a single parameter grade.
Conditional Statements:

The function uses a series of if-else if statements to check the value of grade and return the corresponding letter grade.
if (grade > 79 && grade <= 100) { return 'A'; } - If the grade is greater than 79 and less than or equal to 100, it returns 'A'.
else if (grade >= 60 && grade <= 79) { return 'B'; } - If the grade is between 60 and 79 (inclusive), it returns 'B'.
else if (grade >= 50 && grade <= 59) { return 'C'; } - If the grade is between 50 and 59 (inclusive), it returns 'C'.
else if (grade >= 40 && grade < 50) { return 'D'; } - If the grade is between 40 and 49 (inclusive), it returns 'D'.
else if (grade >= 0 && grade <= 40) { return 'E'; } - If the grade is between 0 and 40 (inclusive), it returns 'E'.
else { return 'Invalid grade'; } - If the grade is outside the range of 0 to 100, it returns 'Invalid grade'.

# Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Welcome to the Speed Detector program! This JavaScript program helps you monitor and evaluate the speed of a car. Based on the speed input, it will either confirm that the speed is acceptable or calculate demerit points for speeding. If the driver accumulates too many demerit points, the program will notify that the driver's license should be suspended.

  ## Overview
The Speed Detector is designed to simulate a simple speed monitoring system. It can be used for educational purposes or as a basic building block for more complex traffic monitoring systems. This program takes a car's speed as input and provides feedback based on predefined speed limits and demerit point rules.

# Features
Speed Check: Validates if the speed is within the acceptable limit.
Demerit Points Calculation: Calculates demerit points for speeds exceeding the limit.
License Suspension Notification: Notifies when the driver’s license should be suspended based on accumulated demerit points.
Simple Interface: Easy-to-use function that can be integrated into larger applications.
Getting Started
To get started with the Speed Detector, you'll need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript. You can run this code in any JavaScript environment, such as a browser console or a Node.js environment.

# Usage
Here's how you can use the Speed Detector:

Copy the provided JavaScript function.
Paste the function into your JavaScript environment.
Call the checkSpeed function with a speed as an argument.
The function will print the result based on the speed.
Function Details
The checkSpeed function takes a single parameter speed, which is the speed of the car. Based on the value of speed, the function will print "Ok" if the speed is within the limit or calculate and print demerit points if the speed exceeds the limit. If the demerit points exceed 12, it will print "License suspended".

 # Explanation of the Function
Function Declaration:

function checkSpeed(speed) { ... } - This declares the function checkSpeed that takes a single parameter speed.
Constants:

const speedLimit = 70; - The speed limit is set to 70 km/h.
const kmPerDemeritPoint = 5; - For every 5 km/h over the speed limit, 1 demerit point is assigned.
Conditional Statements:

if (speed < speedLimit) { console.log("Ok"); } - If the speed is below the speed limit, it prints "Ok".
else { ... } - If the speed exceeds the speed limit, it calculates the demerit points.
const demeritPoints = Math.floor((speed - speedLimit) / kmPerDemeritPoint); - Calculates the demerit points.
if (demeritPoints > 12) { console.log("License suspended"); } else { console.log(Points: ${demeritPoints}); } - If demerit points exceed 12, it prints "License suspended"; otherwise, it prints the number of demerit points.
## Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Welcome to the Net Salary Calculator! This JavaScript program helps you calculate an individual’s net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. It also computes various deductions such as tax (payee), NHIF, and NSSF, and provides the gross and net salary.

# Overview
The Net Salary Calculator is designed to provide a comprehensive calculation of an employee's salary after considering all mandatory deductions. It is useful for both employers and employees to understand the breakdown of salary components and deductions.

# Features
